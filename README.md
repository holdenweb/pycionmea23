PyCon MEA 2023 talk slides with speaker notes

Not a technical talk, this is my explanation of how I came to love
the Python programming language, and why it's so popular.

Note that the Keynote original is > 50MB, and so exceeds the Github
advisory limit on file sizes.

Open _Python Scalable from Microcontroller to Supercomputer.pdf_
to read a slightly expanded version of the talk, with quite a
few of the slide graphics in it.
